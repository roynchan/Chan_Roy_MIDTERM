                Keeping a cat is much more boring than keeping a dog,as you can't do any activities with cats.
                Also cats might make their owners feel emotionally distanced but dogs wonâ€™t.As cats are not as friendly as Dog,cats with seperate themselves with the owners, but dog won't dog will try to fit into the human world and be friendly.

            <p class="Cats are better">
              Cats are better as you don't have to take care of them very often,as walking them or so on.
              Also Cats are more like a pets but not like a messy child as dog,cats is more chill and cool so they wont create a mess all over the place like dogs.
              So Cats are better,it can keep owner away from the stress and worries.
