            <p class="Dogs are better">
                keeping a cat is much more boring than keeping a dog,as you can't do any activities with cats.
                Also cats might make their owners feel emotionally distanced but dogs wonâ€™t.As cats are not as friendly as Dog,cats with seperate themselves with the owners, but dog won't dog will try to fit into the human world and be friendly.
